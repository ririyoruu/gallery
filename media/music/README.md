# Music Folder

Add your romantic background music here!

## How to add music:
1. Put your music file in this folder
2. Name it something like: `romantic_song.mp3` or `love_theme.mp3`
3. Update the `index.html` file to uncomment and point to your music file:

```html
<source src="media/music/romantic_song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
```

## Supported formats:
- .mp3 (most common)
- .ogg 
- .wav
- .m4a

## Suggestions:
- Choose a soft, romantic instrumental song
- Keep the volume moderate so it doesn't overpower the experience
- Pick something that loops well since it will repeat

The music will start playing when she clicks the envelope! ðŸŽµðŸ’•
